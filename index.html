<center><h1>NYCHA Residents Demand Public Housing be Fully Funded</h1></center>
<center><h3>NYCHA Residents in East Harlem demand conventional Section 9 housing to be fully funded by state and federal lawmakers.</h4></center>

<center><p>NYCHA Residents in East Harlem gathered for a rally to demand that conventional public housing be fully funded. New York City Housing Authority has only received a fraction of the funding needed to repair public housing apartments. On top of that, many public housing residents are seeing their conventional public housing apartments converted to Section 8 and RAD/PACT developments, which NYCHA describes as "public-private partnerships," but NYCHA residents describe as "privatization." Human Rights Watch has called PACT a "risky" program and said that eviction rates have gone up in converted housing.</p>
<p>This map shows which boroughs have the most PACT developments (each development can have hundreds of apartments) as well as the number of conventional NYCHA developments. </p></center>

<center><p> NYCHA says they have converted over 19,000 apartments to PACT and that more than 18,000 are in the process of being converted. Tamika Mapp, District Leader for the 60th Assembly District Part D told New York City News Service that Section 9 housing is the only true affordable housing, and that Section 8 housing doesn't deliver on its promises. "If you look at the way the Section 8 model is, if you make a dollar too much now you’re going to end up paying full rent and you’re not going to get the subsidy. Section 9 is the only true affordable housing because it’s based on 30% of their income.”</p></center>
