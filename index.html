<center><h1>Most Felonies on NYC Subways Drop in 2023</h1></center>
<center><h3>Most felonies besides burglary and felony assault dropped in 2023 compared to 2022.</h4></center>

<p>The New York City subway system has a reputation for being dangerous, and at the beginning of this year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and New York Governor Kathy Hochul said that they were proud that crime decreased over 2022. “That is a trend that we can feel good about,” Governor Hochul said, according to the New York Time. “As long as that continues to hold.”</p>
<p>According to MTA and NYPD data, it seems like it did hold. Most felony crimes have decreased over the course of 2023. This chart shows the type of felony and the difference in instances since 2022 so far this year.</p>

<p> The data show that instances of robbery have decreased by 57 since 2022 and instances of grand larceny decreased by 39. Rape instances on the subway decreased by five and murder by one. Burglaries and felony assault on the subway unfortunately increased by five and 11 respectively. </p>
